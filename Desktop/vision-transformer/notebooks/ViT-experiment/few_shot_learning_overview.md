## What is Few-Shot Learning?

Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where models can make accurate predictions using very limited training data - typically just a few examples per class. The fundamental goal is **"learning to learn"** rather than memorizing specific training instances.

Unlike traditional machine learning that requires thousands of examples per class, few-shot learning enables models to:
- Quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data
- Generalize from limited examples
- Transfer knowledge across related domains
- Reduce dependence on large labeled datasets

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **k-way** | Number of classes in the support set | 5-way = 5 different classes |
| **n-shot** | Number of samples per class | 5-shot = 5 examples per class |
| **Support set** | Small set of labeled examples used for learning | Training examples for new classes |
| **Query set** | New, unseen samples to be classified | Test examples to classify |
| **Episode** | A training iteration with randomly sampled classes | One meta-learning step |
| **Meta-learning** | Learning how to learn from multiple tasks | Training across many few-shot scenarios |

## Core Principles

### 1. Meta-Learning ("Learning to Learn")
- Train on multiple related tasks so the model learns how to quickly adapt to new tasks
- Focus on learning adaptation strategies rather than task-specific features
- Enables rapid generalization to unseen scenarios

### 2. Similarity Learning
- Understand relationships and differences between objects
- Learn meaningful feature representations that capture class similarities
- Compare rather than memorize specific instances

### 3. Generalization
- Transfer knowledge from training classes to completely unseen classes
- Leverage shared structure across different but related tasks
- Maintain performance with minimal new data

## How It Works

### Training Phase (Meta-Training)
1. **Episode Sampling**: Randomly sample k classes from training set
2. **Support/Query Split**: For each class, split examples into support (few) and query (many)
3. **Adaptation**: Model learns to classify queries using only support examples
4. **Meta-Update**: Update model parameters based on query performance
5. **Repeat**: Iterate across many episodes to learn general adaptation strategies

```
Training Episode Example:
- Classes: [Cat, Dog, Bird] (3-way)
- Support: 5 examples per class (5-shot)
- Query: 15 examples per class
- Goal: Classify queries using support examples only
```

### Testing Phase (Meta-Testing)
1. **New Classes**: Present model with classes it has never seen during training
2. **Support Examples**: Provide few labeled examples of these new classes
3. **Adaptation**: Model uses learned adaptation skills to understand new classes
4. **Classification**: Classify new query examples from these unseen classes

## Major Approaches

### 1. Prototypical Networks (Most Popular)
**Concept**: Create a "prototype" (average embedding) for each class from support examples, then classify by finding the closest prototype.

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Embed support examples: f(x) → feature vectors
2. Compute class prototypes: c_k = mean(f(x_i)) for class k
3. Classify query by nearest prototype: argmin_k d(f(query), c_k)
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple and interpretable
- Strong empirical performance
- No complex meta-learning required
- Fast inference

### 2. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
**Concept**: Learn initial parameters that can quickly adapt to new tasks through gradient descent.

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Sample task batch
2. For each task: compute gradients on support set
3. Apply gradients to get task-specific parameters
4. Evaluate on query set with adapted parameters
5. Meta-update initial parameters
```

**Advantages**:
- Task-agnostic approach
- Few adaptation steps needed
- Strong theoretical foundation

### 3. Matching Networks
**Concept**: Learn to compare and match examples using attention mechanisms.

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Encode support set and queries
2. Compute attention weights between queries and support
3. Weighted combination of support labels for prediction
```

**Advantages**:
- End-to-end differentiable
- Natural handling of variable support set sizes
- Strong performance on complex tasks

### 4. Relation Networks
**Concept**: Learn a relation module that computes similarity scores between examples.

**Features**:
- Learnable similarity metric
- Deep networks for relation computation
- Flexible architecture design

## Performance Characteristics

### Key Patterns:
- **Accuracy decreases** as number of classes (k-way) increases
- **Accuracy improves** with more examples per class (n-shot)
- **Diminishing returns** beyond 5-10 shots for many tasks
- **Domain similarity** strongly affects transfer performance

### Typical Evaluation Scenarios:
- **5-way 1-shot**: 5 classes, 1 example each
- **5-way 5-shot**: 5 classes, 5 examples each  
- **20-way 1-shot**: 20 classes, 1 example each

### Benchmark Datasets:
- **Omniglot**: Handwritten characters (1623 classes)
- **Mini-ImageNet**: Subset of ImageNet (100 classes)
- **CIFAR-FS**: CIFAR-100 based (100 classes)
- **Tiered-ImageNet**: Hierarchical ImageNet subset

## Relevance to Cybersecurity

Your approach of training on 6 attack types while holding out 3 types (SqlInjection, Recon-PortScan, DictionaryBruteForce) perfectly exemplifies few-shot learning in cybersecurity:

### Why Few-Shot Learning Matters for Cybersecurity:

1. **Emerging Threats**: New attack types constantly emerge in the wild
2. **Limited Initial Data**: Security teams rarely have large datasets for novel attacks
3. **Rapid Response**: Need to detect and classify new threats quickly
4. **Transfer Learning**: Features learned from known attacks should generalize to unknown ones
5. **Zero-Day Detection**: Ability to identify previously unseen attack patterns

### Your Implementation Strengths:

- ✅ **Clean Experimental Design**: Complete separation prevents data leakage
- ✅ **Realistic Scenario**: Mimics real-world emergence of new attack types  
- ✅ **Academic Rigor**: Follows established few-shot learning protocols
- ✅ **Meaningful Evaluation**: Tests true generalization capabilities

### Potential Extensions:

1. **Prototypical Networks**: Implement prototype-based classification for held-out classes
2. **Episodic Training**: Train with few-shot episodes using the 6 base classes
3. **Feature Analysis**: Analyze which learned features transfer to new attack types
4. **Incremental Learning**: Study how to incorporate new attack types over time
