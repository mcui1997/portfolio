# Adversarial Examples Literature Review: From FGSM to Modern Methods

## Overview

Adversarial examples are carefully crafted inputs designed to fool machine learning models into making incorrect predictions. These attacks have evolved from simple gradient-based methods to sophisticated semantic-preserving techniques that pose significant challenges to AI system security.

## Classic Methods

### Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
- **Principle**: Single-step attack using gradient sign: `x_adv = x + ε * sign(∇_x J(x, y))`
- **Advantages**: Fast, simple implementation
- **Limitations**: Limited attack strength, easily detectable

### Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
- **Principle**: Iterative FGSM with projection back to ε-ball
- **Advantages**: Stronger than FGSM, better optimization
- **Limitations**: Higher computational cost

## State-of-the-Art Methods (2024-2025)

### AutoDAN
- Generates coherent, interpretable adversarial prompts for LLMs
- Bypasses perplexity filters while maintaining semantic meaning
- Exhibits sophisticated jailbreak strategies without prior knowledge

### CAVALRY-V
- Targets video multimodal large language models
- Uses dual-objective semantic-visual loss functions
- Achieves 22.8% improvement over baseline attacks on commercial systems

### M-Attack
- **Breakthrough**: >90% success rate against GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, and o1 models
- Focuses perturbations on semantically rich regions
- Demonstrates vulnerabilities in most advanced AI systems

## Key Differences: Classic vs. Modern

| Aspect | FGSM/PGD | Modern Methods |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Target** | Computer vision | Multimodal systems, LLMs |
| **Approach** | Simple gradients | Semantic encoding |
| **Transferability** | Limited | High cross-model success |
| **Detection** | Often detectable | Bypass sophisticated filters |
| **Realism** | May be unrealistic | Maintain semantic coherence |
