# Vision Transformer for Network Traffic Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a cutting-edge approach to network intrusion detection using Vision Transformers (ViT). By converting raw packet bytes into 2D images and leveraging self-attention mechanisms, we can capture both local and global patterns in network traffic to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.

### Key Innovation
- **Patch-based encoding**: Bundle contiguous bytes into fixed-length patches (up to 16 patches per image)
- **Vision Transformer**: Efficiently capture global context across entire packet flows
- **Few-shot learning**: Rapidly adapt to novel malware classes without full retraining
