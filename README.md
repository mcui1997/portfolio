## About Me

Cloud Security Engineer with 3+ years of experience securing enterprise applications and infrastructure at General Motors. I specialize in cloud security architecture, Infrastructure as Code, and AI-powered security solutions. Currently pursuing MS in Cybersecurity at Johns Hopkins University while building hands-on security projects that demonstrate real-world skills.

**What I Do:** Secure cloud infrastructure, build security automation tools, design threat detection systems, and apply machine learning to cybersecurity problems.

## Featured Projects

### Cloud Security Engineering

**[Secure Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform](https://github.com/mcui1997/secure-cloud-infra)**  
Production-grade secure 3-tier web application deployed on Azure using Infrastructure as Code. Implements defense-in-depth with network segmentation, AKS security hardening, Key Vault secrets management, and automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline.

*Technologies: Terraform, Azure (AKS, Application Gateway, NSGs), GitHub Actions, Docker, Python*

**[Cloud Security Assessment & Remediation Framework](https://github.com/mcui1997/cloud-sec-scanner)**  
Python-based automated scanner detecting Azure misconfigurations across 50+ security controls including exposed storage, weak network rules, IAM violations, and missing encryption. Includes automated Terraform remediation scripts and CIS Benchmark compliance reporting.

*Technologies: Python, Azure SDK, Terraform, Azure Policy*

### Security Operations & Detection

**[Enterprise SIEM Deployment & Threat Detection](https://github.com/mcui1997/azure-siem-lab)**  
Azure-based SIEM environment with Wazuh for multi-platform log aggregation. Developed custom detection rules for MITRE ATT&CK techniques including brute force attacks, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. Simulated real-world attacks and documented investigation workflows.

*Technologies: Wazuh, Azure VMs, Sysmon, MITRE ATT&CK Framework, Python*

### AI & Machine Learning for Security

**[AI-Powered Malware Detection System](https://github.com/mcui1997/vision-transformer)**  
Novel computer vision approach for malware classification using vision transformers, achieving 95.8% accuracy across 9 attack types. Converted network packet payloads into multi-channel image representations and trained custom PyTorch model on 108,000+ samples from CIC-IoT23 dataset.

*Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Network Traffic Analysis*

**[Adversarial QR Code Generation](https://github.com/mcui1997/qr-gan)**  
Advanced GAN architecture for secure QR code synthesis with embedded cryptographic payloads. Optimized generator-discriminator training to produce functionally scannable codes with adversarial robustness, achieving 98%+ scanning reliability.

*Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, GANs, Cryptography*
