## About Me
Cybersecurity Engineer bridging software development and security operations, with proven experience building secure systems at General Motors and hands-on expertise in threat detection, cloud security, and AI-powered defense mechanisms.

I've deployed Azure-based SIEM environments with custom detection rules, conducted network vulnerability assessments with comprehensive remediation strategies, and designed HIPAA-compliant access control architectures following NIST frameworks. My research applies machine learning to cybersecurityâ€”developing vision transformers for malware classification (95.8% accuracy) and adversarial systems for secure data embedding.

**Certifications:** CompTIA Security+, Azure-500 Cloud Certificate

## Featured Projects

### Cloud Security & Infrastructure

**[Cloud IaC with Terraform](https://github.com/mcui1997/secure-azure-app)**  
Enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code project deploying secure Azure environments using Terraform with automated compliance controls and network segmentation. Implements modular architecture with reusable components for VNets, subnets, Network Security Groups, and Azure Firewall with least-privilege access policies and encryption at rest. Developed GitOps workflow with automated security scanning using Checkov and tfsec.

*Technologies: Terraform, Azure, GitHub Actions, Checkov*

**[AWS Cloud Security Scanner](https://github.com/mcui1997/aws-security-scanner)**  
Automated Python scanner for detecting AWS security misconfigurations across S3, EC2, IAM, VPC, and RDS. Identifies exposed resources, overprivileged roles, missing encryption, and compliance violations mapped to CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark. Features comprehensive security assessment with automated remediation through Terraform and boto3 scripts.

*Technologies: Python, boto3, Terraform, AWS SDK*

### Security Operations & Detection

**[Cloud-Based SOC & SIEM Lab](https://github.com/mcui1997/azure-siem-lab)**  
Production-grade Security Operations Center environment deployed on Microsoft Azure featuring Wazuh SIEM for centralized threat detection and log analysis. Architected secure VNet infrastructure with three monitored endpoints running Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows Server 2022 agents. Developed custom detection rules for SSH brute force attacks with MITRE ATT&CK mapping (T1110.001), achieving immediate alerting within seconds of simulated attacks.

*Technologies: Azure, Wazuh, Sysmon, Ubuntu, Windows Server*

### AI & Machine Learning for Security

**[Vision Transformer for Network Security](https://github.com/mcui1997/vision-transformer)**  
Novel computer vision approach for network attack classification using Vision Transformers. Achieved 93.30% accuracy across 9 attack types by converting packet payloads into visual representations using a 5-channel encoding method on the CIC-IoT23 dataset. Demonstrates that treating network traffic as images enables sophisticated computer vision techniques for threat detection.

*Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Network Traffic Analysis*

**[AI Spam Detection System](https://github.com/mcui1997/spam-filter)**  
Machine learning spam classifier utilizing Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF feature extraction for automated email filtering. Implements comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline including URL removal, HTML sanitization, and n-gram analysis. Achieves 95-98% classification accuracy through optimized hyperparameters with interactive Streamlit interface.

*Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, TF-IDF*

**[IoT Botnet Detection System](https://github.com/mcui1997/botnet-detector)**  
Comparative analysis system implementing both traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for detecting IoT botnet behavior in network traffic. Built interactive Streamlit application enabling real-time model training on UNSW 2018 IoT Botnet Dataset. Achieved 85-95% accuracy with ML models and 80-90% with DL models processing raw data.

*Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Streamlit*

## Research & Analysis

**[Vision Transformer with Few Shot Learning - Publication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18PNRFCJbhmeCsn_LwfRVt496Z7HSIWyk/view?usp=sharing)**  
Explored applying Vision Transformers to network security by converting packet payloads into visual representations for attack classification. Achieved 93.30% accuracy across 9 attack types using a novel 5-channel encoding method on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.

**[HIPAA NIST Gap Analysis](https://github.com/mcui1997/hippa-nist-gap-analysis)**  
Enterprise cybersecurity analysis for implementing Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) in a hospital transplant center environment. Conducted comprehensive gap analysis using NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and NIST IR 8170 to transition from RBAC to ABAC, enhancing security for electronic health records while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

**[Virtual Network Vulnerability Analysis](https://github.com/mcui1997/network-vulnerability-analysis)**  
Comprehensive vulnerability assessment of a virtualized network environment using OpenVAS and Kali Linux. Conducted security analysis across DMZ, internal networks, and DNS servers, identifying critical vulnerabilities including authentication weaknesses, cryptographic failures, and default credentials. Developed detailed mitigation strategies aligned with NIST, CIS, and ISO security frameworks.
